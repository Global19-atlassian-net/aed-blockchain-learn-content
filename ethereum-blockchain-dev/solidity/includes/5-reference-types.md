# Reference types
Another common type you'll deal with when writing contracts are reference types. The main difference is that values of reference types can be modified through different names.

When using a reference type, you must explicitly provide the data area where the type is stored in a data location. Other examples of reference types are arrays and structs.

## Data location
Every reference type specifies a data location where tje data is stored. The three options are: `memory`, `storage`, and `calldata`.

Example:

## Arrays
Arrays are a way to store similar data in a set data structure. Arrays in Solidity are similar to arrays in other programming languages. They can either have a fixed or dynamic size.

Examples:

## Structs
