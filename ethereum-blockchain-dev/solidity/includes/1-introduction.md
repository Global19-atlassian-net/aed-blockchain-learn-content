# Introduction

The first major use case for blockchain has been centered around cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But what about when you want to use blockchain to transfer some digital asset other than currency? Suppose you have an online marketplace and want to use blockchain technology to help facilitate the buying, selling, and transferring of goods.

In that case, you can use a programming language called [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) to code how your online marketplace operates and what actions participants can take. By programming these actions allowed on the network, you can create your own blockchains that are secure and transparent to all participants.

In this module, you will have explore the fundamentals of the Solidity language, and learn a bit about how to program smart contracts along the way. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain what Solidity is and how the features of the language work
- Understand the components of a smart contract
- Create smart contracts with Solidity

## Prerequisites

- Blockchain fundamentals knowledge
- Ethereum platform knowledge
- Familiarity with any programming language
