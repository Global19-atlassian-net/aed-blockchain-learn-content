# Token types

There are a few primary types of tokens:

- ERC20
- ERC721
- ERC777
- ERC1155

## ERC20

One of the most significant tokens is known as ERC-20, which is the technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation.  

An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like currency exchange or voting rights.

Fungible means that things are equivalent and interchangeable. How much do you have). Non-fungible means that things are unique and distinct. Which ones do you have.

The ERC-20 token defines a common list of rules that all Ethereum tokens must follow.  

There are six different functions defined which include basic functionality issues, like how the tokens are transferred and how users can access token data.

## ERC721

ERC721 is the top solution for non-fungible tokens, which is often used for collectibles and games. Each token is unique.

## ERC777

ERC777 is a richer standard for fungible tokens, enabling new use cases and building on past learnings. It is backwards compatible with ERC20. It is focused around allowing more complex interactions when trading tokens. It brings tokens and Ether closer together.

## ERC1155

ERC1155 is a novel standard for multi-tokens, allowing for a single contract to represent multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens, along with batched operations for increased gas efficiency.
