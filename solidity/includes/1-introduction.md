# Introduction
The first major use case for blockchain has been centered around cryptocurrency. But what about when you want to use blockchain to transfer something other than currency? You can use a programming language to code how and what gets transferred on a blockchain. 

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is referred to as the "world's programmable blockchain" which means you can use it to create and transfer lots of different digital assets. And with the emergence of Ethereum of 2015, there have been advancements on the tools you can use to program on the Ethereum network.

[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) is the most popular programming language for the Ethereum blockchain. In this module, you will have the chance to explore the fundamentals of the Solidity language, and learn a bit about smart contracts along the way.
