# Learn what smart contracts are

## About

A smart contract is a program stored inside of a blockchain, the code is assigned an address (just like your wallet has an address, addresses look like: 0x8E698aeA7d456d4A8D8d0485BDC390EFCebC56FA).

Solidity is turing complete so you could express most program logic using solidity. The world is your oyster.

Blockchain apps have key properties and advantages of:

- **Transparent**: It is publicly readable by others on the blockchain and accessible via APIs
- **Immutable**: Once a smart contract is created it cannot be changed again.
- **Distributed**: Output of the contract is validated / verified by nodes on the network. Contract states can be publicly visible (yes in some cases even “private” variables). Even contract bytecode can be decompiled (in some cases) back into solidity.

## Use cases
