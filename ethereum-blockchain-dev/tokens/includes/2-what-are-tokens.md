# Learn about tokens

A blockchain token can represent loyalty points for an airline, gaming platform, or retail store. A token can grant users special permissions on a platform, or exclusive access to a new service. Another blockchain token could also represent other cryptocurrencies.

## History of tokens

Tokens are not a new thing and have existed since long before the emergence of blockchain.

 Tokens have represented any form of economic value. Shells and beads were probably the earliest types of tokens used. Other types of tokens are, for example, casinos chips, vouchers, bonus points, stock certificates, concert entry tokens, dinner reservations, ID cards, club memberships, or airline tickets.  

Even our typical fiat currency is a type of token. The point is you can build up tokens and trade them in to get something of value.

Tokens are used in computing to allow a right to perform some operation or manage access rights.  

A web browser, for example, sends tokens to websites when we surf the web, and our phone sends tokens to the phone system every time we use it. A more tangible form of computer tokens are tracking codes, or QR codes.

## Blockchain tokens

Blockchain tokens can combine both concepts: access rights to some property or permission to access the property. This property or service can be public (Bitcoin Network) or private (an apartment that is rented out by a private person).

Blockchain tokens represent a set of rules, encoded in a smart contract. Every token belongs to a blockchain address. These tokens are accessible with a wallet. Only the person who has the wallet with private key for that address can access those tokens.

Ethereum is based on the use of tokens, which can be bought, sold, or traded. Tokens are like Ether (ETH) but may have different design decisions, purposes and help operate different decentralized apps (DAPPS) and facilitate crypto-economics of different Blockchain ecosystems.

Tokens represent a diverse range of digital assets, such as vouchers, IOUs, or even real-world, tangible objects.

Take for example, Augur. Augur is a network that functions as a prediction market - you can think of it as a betting platform. Augur has its own token called REP. This is no different than you using tokens perhaps to take public transport. We have fiat or local currency, for example CAD, which sometimes also comes in coins, and also TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) tokens. Each TTC token allows you to take 1 subway ride. You can purchase TTC tokens using CAD (just like you can purchase REP using ETH) but they are not the same thing. TTC tokens are specifically for the eco-system of Toronto Transit.

When you think about it, tokens are essentially smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum blockchain. Because everything in Ethereum is just a smart contract, and there are no rules restricting what smart contracts do and represent.

The community has developed a variety of standards for documenting how a contract can operate with other contracts.
