# What is Solidity

## An overview
Solidity is an object-oriented language for writing smart contracts. And smart contracts are code that specify the rules and behavior of how to transfer digital assets. You use Solidity to program smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain network. Smart contracts contain state and programmable logic. Transactions instantiate smart contracts and execute functions that change state. Therefore, smart contracts enable you to create a business workflow.

Solidity was based off of many programming languages before it, including C++, Python, and JavaScript. That means that if you're familiar with any of those languages, looking at Solidity code will feel very familiar.

Solidity is statically typed, which means that type checking happens at compile-time as opposed to run-time as happens with dynamically typed languages. 

With a statically typed language, the type of each variable needs to be specified.

Python and JavaScript are dynamically-typed languages, whereas C++ and C# are statically typed.

It supports inheritance so that functions, variables, and other properties from a contract class can be used in another.

And it also supports complex user-defined types like...

Solidity is an open-source programming language. You can learn more at their GitHub repository: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity

## What is Ethereum
Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain platforms out there, right behind Bitcoin. What makes Ethereum unique is that it allows for the transfer of it's cryptocurrency, Ether. It is also programmable, which means you can code contract definitions that can be used to code lots of different digital assets.


## The Ethereum Virtual Machine
Solidity contracts target the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM for short.
