# Exercise: Install Truffle

## About Truffle

Truffle is the most popular development framework for Ethereum. It can easily be installed with the help of the node package manager.

With Truffle, you get:

- Built-in smart contract building, compilation, deployment, testing and more.
- Network management for deploying to any number of public & private networks.
- Package management for dependencies
- Interactive console for direct contract communication.
- Configurable build pipeline with support for tight integration.
- External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

## Install Truffle

From your terminal, you can install Truffle with the help of npm. Type:

`npm install -g truffle`

To confirm truffle is installed, type:

`truffle`

That will show the version installed and present the list of commands available to use Truffle with:

```solidity
$ truffle

Usage: truffle <command> [options]

Commands:

## Get started with using Truffle

Now that Truffle is installed, let's use it to run the tests that were generated as part of our newSolidityProject.

### Test the contract

You can find the test file in test/HelloBlockchain.js. Take a look through the test file to try to understand what's being tested.

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to Terminal -> New Terminal
2. In the terminal type: `truffle test`
In the terminal you will see which tests passed, and if any test failed (We will talk more about how to write tests in a later unit, but this gets you some exposure to running tests with Truffle.
