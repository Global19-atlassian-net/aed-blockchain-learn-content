Ethereum is a protocol with multiple independent networks that are part of this protocol.

Networks are different Ethereum environments you can access for development, testing, or production use cases. It’s helpful to have a good understanding of the networks that Ethereum provides and how to work with the networks of your choice. For whatever solution you have, you’re going to need to choose if you will have a private or public solution and how to go from development to a test network to production network.

The goal of this module is to get more familiar with the network options in the Ethereum protocol, some tools you can use to interact with them, and learn how to connect and deploy to different networks.

## Learning objectives

 By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Identify the public and private networks available in Ethereum.
- Explain what is required to prepare a solution for the mainnet
- Know how to use Metamask with Infura to connect a solution to networks
