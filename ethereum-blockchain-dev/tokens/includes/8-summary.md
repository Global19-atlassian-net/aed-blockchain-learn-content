# Summary

In this module, you learned about what contracts are and how you can write token contracts by using OpenZeppelin. You should now have an understanding of why you would want to use token contracts, and ideas about other types of contracts you can write that use tokens.

## Resources

For continued learning, you can refer to the [OpenZeppelin token documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/tokens). There you can find more examples of other contract standards and explore writing more contract tokens on your own.
