# Write your first contract

Now let's put together what we've learned into a complete smart contract example.

In this example, we have a marketplace. So far, you can list an item for sale and you can buy an item. The two roles involved are a seller and a buyer.

## Simple Marketplace example

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.7.0 <0.8.0;

contract Marketplace {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    mapping (address => uint) public balances;

    event ListItem(address seller, uint price);
    event PurchasedItem(address seller, address buyer, uint price);

    enum StateType {
          ItemAvailable,
          ItemPurchased
        }

    StateType public State;

    constructor() public {
        seller = msg.sender;
        State = StateType.ItemAvailable;
    }

    function buy(address seller, address buyer, uint price) public {
        require(price <= balances[buyer], "Insufficient balance");
        State = StateType.ItemPurchased;
        balances[buyer] -= price;
        balances[seller] += price;

        emit PurchasedItem(msg.seller, buyer, msg.value);
    }
```

I'll explain the main components of this smart contract:

- There are 3 state variables: buyer, seller, and balances
- There are 2 events: `ListItem` and `PurchasedItem`
- There is an enum with 2 values: `ItemAvailable` and `ItemPurchased`
- The constructor will assign the seller user as msg.sender, and set the initial state to ItemAvailable. This constructor is called when the contract is created.
- The `buy` function takes 3 parameters: `seller`, `buyer`, and `price`. It has a requirement that the buyer has enough money for the purchase. Then it transfers money from the buyer to the seller, and finally a message is emitted.

## More complex marketplace example

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.7.0 <0.8.0;

contract Marketplace {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    mapping (address => uint) public balances;

    event ListItem(address seller, uint price);
    event PurchasedItem(address seller, address buyer, uint price);

    enum StateType {
          ItemAvailable,
          ItemBought
        }

    StateType public State;

    constructor() public {
        seller = msg.sender;
        State = StateType.ItemAvailable;
    }

    function buy(address seller, address buyer, uint price) public {
        require(price <= balances[sender], "Insufficient balance");
        State = StateType.ItemBought;
        balances[buyer] -= price;
        balances[seller] += price;

        emit PurchasedItem(msg.sender, buyer, msg.value);
    }

    modifier onlySeller() {
        require(
            msg.sender == seller,
            "Only seller can put an item up for sale."
        );
        _;
    }

    struct Items_Schema {
        uint256 _id:
        uint256 _price:
        string _name;
    }

    function listItem(uint 256 memory _price, string memory _name) public {
        item_id += 1;
        item[vehicle_id] = Items_Schema(item_id, _price, _name);

        emit ListItem(address seller, uint price);
    }
```

## Challenge

Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to explore more smart contract examples in Solidity. Remix is an in-browser IDE that is instant to get started without having to create an account or sign in. You can immediately write, test, compile, and deploy contracts.

I encourage you to explore the pre-built contracts available in Remix and then to copy this smart contract over in a new file named `Marketplace.sol`.
