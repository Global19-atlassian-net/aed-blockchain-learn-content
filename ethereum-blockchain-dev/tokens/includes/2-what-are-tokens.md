# Learn about tokens

The token is one of blockchain's most powerful and often most misunderstood tools. It's typically misunderstood, because a blockchain token can represent almost anything that we want to assign a value to whether the digital asset represents something virtual or even a real-world, tangible object.

A token can grant users special permissions on a platform, or exclusive access to a new service. Tokens could also represent cryptocurrencies. Let's dive into the history of tokens and explore different use cases to demonstrate what exactly a token is.

## History of tokens

Tokens are not a new thing and have existed since long before the emergence of blockchain.

 Tokens have represented any form of economic value. Shells and beads were probably the earliest types of tokens used. Other types of tokens are, for example, casinos chips, vouchers, bonus points, stock certificates, concert entry tokens, dinner reservations, ID cards, club memberships, or airline tickets. The list can go on and on.

Even our typical fiat currency, which includes cash and coins, is a type of token. The point is you can build up tokens and trade them in to get something of value or some service in return.

Tokens are used in computing to allow a right to perform some operation or manage access rights.  

A web browser, for example, sends tokens to websites when we surf the web, and our phone sends tokens to the phone system every time we use it. A more tangible form of computer tokens are tracking codes, or QR codes, which are scanned and return information.

## Blockchain tokens

Blockchain tokens can combine both concepts: access rights to some property or permission to access the property. This property or service can be public, like a Bitcoin Network that anyone can join, or private, like an apartment that is rented out by an individual or group one at a time.

Blockchain tokens represent a set of rules, encoded in a smart contract. Every token belongs to a blockchain address. These tokens are accessible with a wallet so that only the person who has the wallet with private key for that address can access those tokens.

The Ethereum blockchain platform is based on the use of tokens, which can be bought, sold, or traded. Tokens are like Ether (ETH) but may have different design decisions, purposes and help operate different decentralized apps (DAPPS) and facilitate crypto-economics of different Blockchain ecosystems.

Take for example, Augur. Augur is a network that functions as a prediction market - you can think of it as a betting platform. Augur has its own token called REP. This is no different than you using tokens perhaps to take public transport. We have fiat or local currency, for example the Canadian dollar (CAD), which sometimes also comes in coins, and also Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) tokens. Each TTC token allows you to take 1 subway ride. You can purchase TTC tokens using CAD (just like you can purchase REP using ETH) but they are not the same thing. TTC tokens are specifically for the eco-system of Toronto Transit.

There are different kinds of tokens available that usually fall into two categories:

- **fungible:**
  - equivalent and exchangeable
  - Ask: how much do you have?
- **non-fungible**
  - unique and distinct
  - Ask: which ones do you have?

When you break it down, tokens are essentially smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum blockchain. Because everything in Ethereum is just a smart contract, and there are no rules restricting what smart contracts do and represent, the community has developed standards to document how a token contract can operate with other contracts. The standards also describe the implementation of each token type.
